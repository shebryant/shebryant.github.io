  <h1>Ready for Decadence</h1>

      I'm super excited that Phase 0 has finally started.  I've wanted to switch careers and segue into tech for quite some time and I'm closer now to achieving that goal than I ever have been before. I can barely contain my enthusiasm when I think about it.

        There are lots of things about DBC's culture that really resonate with me.  I love that the program is so collaboorative and that there is a sincere desire to move beyond merely teaching people to program, but to focus on the mind and body as well.  The curriculum is very holistic and I think that this fact will greatly benefit me and other students in my cohort.

        While I am incredibly excited and my expectations of what my experience at DBC will be like are steeped in optimism, the reality is that Dev Bootcamp is completely uncharted territory for me. Naturally, there are some things that make me nervous. I wonder what pair programming everyday will be like?  I wonder if the dynamics of our group will work for all parties involved and if we each will find ways to thrive. I wonder if my introversion will ever be percieved as standoffishness, if it will be a struggle to be required to spend so much of the day working so closely with someone else. I wonder if there will be opporturnities to recharge so that I can bring all of myself to the work I do in pairs.

        Even with all of the questions swirling around in this head of mine, I am convinced that the decision to attend Dev Bootcamp was the right decison for me. And, I am determined to have a kitchen mentality rather than a restaurant mentality. I am fully prepared to pull up my sleeves and, like a chef, masterfully curate the richly decadent experience I intend to have with instructors and students alike.
