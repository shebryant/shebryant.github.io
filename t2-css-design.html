Whoa!  Week 2 of Dev Bootcamp has come to a SWIFT end.  We’re learning so much and SO fast.  During this week’s lesson’s we learned the difference between margins, borders, and padding.  I don’t know about you, but I’ve always had a clear understanding of what borders are, margins even, but you throw padding into the mix and I’m completely lost.  I’ve seen padding written in CSS files before, but I’ve never been entirely sure what it is.  I was thrilled to get a bit of clarification and want to take just a brief moment to pass the info along so that you also can be clear!
</p>
<p>
A margin is the space around an element, and the more space that is around an element, the more space there is between that element and others.
</p>
<p>
Borders you may be more familiar with.  A border is the edge of an element, essentially the line that outlines its perimeter.  
</p>
<p>
Now what we’ve all been waiting for…dun, dun, dun…padding. Padding is the space that exists between content and the border.  You are able to adjust CSS to move borders closer to or farther away from content.
</p>
<p>
Here is a picture that shows each.

I hope that helps!
