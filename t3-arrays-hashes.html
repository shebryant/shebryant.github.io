<h1> Looking for ARRAY of Sunshine, ‘Cause Week 3 Makes Me Want to Grab My Things and HASH a Go Go!</h1>
<h4>June 7, 2015</h4>
<section>		   
     <p>		     
So week 3 of my Dev Bootcamp experience has come to a close, and oh what a week it has been.  I’m still figuring out what it means to balance my life in the midst of full-time work, progressively challenging DBC assignments, and you know regular adulting (i.e. dishes, laundry, eating…getting out of bed, you get it).
     </p>		
<p>
This week’s lessons were an introduction to Ruby.  Listen, Ruby is no HTML or CSS, and we’re definitely not in Kansas anymore.  But even, with that, it hasn’t been sooo bad.  It’s just been time consuming and has required slightly more brain power than say— HTML.  Well, I promised to share the things that I learn with you as I learn them.  This week, we’re talking arrays and hashes.
     </p>		     
     <p>		
In Ruby, an object-oriented language, arrays and hashes are both popular structures for storing data.  While they have some similarities, they have some important differences.
</p>		
Arrays are essentially objects that contain ordered lists of other objects.  You can store any kind or any combination of objects in an array. They are integer-indexed collections of any object.  Arrays can be created by using brackets, [].  For clarity’s sake, here is an example of an array provided by RubyMonk<br>
array = [1, ‘one’, 2, ‘two’]   
</p>
<p>
Hashes are collections of data structures that consist of key-value pairs.  Hashes are declared using curly braces, {}.  Consider this example provided by RubyMonk:<br>
student_ages = {<br>
    "Jack" => 10,<br>
    "Jill" => 12,<br>
    "Bob" => 14<br>
  }
</p>
<p>
The names that are listed are “keys” and the numbers that are listed are ‘values.’  You can both create a new Hash and retrieve a Hash by referring to its key.  Hashes are unordered.
</p>
<p>
So, both arrays and hashes store data…what sets them apart?  This was a little fuzzy for me too.  How I understand it though is that arrays are very much like simple containers. They store, or contain, things that you can call up (access value) using their index.  For instance, in our example, array[0] gives you the result of ‘1.’  However, with Hashes, you define and customize keys to whatever you want and can then access their value using the keys you created.
