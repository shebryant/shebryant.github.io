          I'm super excited that Phase 0 has finally started. I have wanted to switch careers and segue into tech for quite some time and I am closer now to achieving that goal than I ever have been before. I can barely contain my enthusiasm when I think about it.
          <br><br>
          There are lots of things about DBC's culture that really resonate with me. I love that the program is so collaboorative and that there is a sincere desire to move beyond merely teaching people to program, but to focus on the mind and body as well. The curriculum is very holistic and I think that this fact will greatly benefit me and other students in my cohort.
          <br><br>
          While I am incredibly excited and my expectations of what my experience at DBC will be like are steeped in optimism, the reality is that Dev Bootcamp is completely uncharted territory for me. Naturally, there are some things that make me nervous. I wonder what pair programming everyday will be like? I wonder if the dynamics of our group will work for all parties involved and if we each will find ways to thrive. I wonder if my introversion will ever be percieved as standoffishness, if it will be a struggle to be required to spend so much of the day working so closely with someone else. I wonder if there will be opporturnities to recharge so that I can bring all of myself to the work I do in pairs.
          <br><br>
          Even with all of the questions swirling around in this head of mine, I am convinced that the decision to attend Dev Bootcamp is the right decison for me. And, I am determined to have a kitchen mentality rather than a restaurant mentality. I am fully prepared to pull up my sleeves and, like a chef, masterfully curate the richly decadent experience I intend to have with instructors and students alike.

      <h1 class="post-title">The Nit and Grit of Git.</h1>
      <h2 class="date">May 24, 2015</h2>
      <p class="post-content">
          I can barely believe that the first week of my Dev Bootcamp experience has come and GONE! Wow, what a ride it's already been.  I'm so excited to learn so many new concepts, and SO fast.  It feels a bit like drinking from the fire hydrant. I suppose I should get used to that; things won't slow down - they'll intensify. I want to hold on to every ounce of the material being crammed into my brain these days. I've found that one of the best ways to retain new knowledge is to teach what you are learning to someone else.  So, the more I learn, the more I'm going to to share with YOU (and by you, I mean any poor soul who will listen)!  
          <br><br>
          This week, we've been learning about git. Technically speaking, (see what I did there?) git is a distributive version control system. If you are anything like me just a week ago, you're definitely asking what the heck any of that means.  Well, version control is kind of a bit like Microsoft Word's or Pages' track changes feature. The track changes feature in word processors allows different users to edit text, as well make comments, and it meticulously keeps track of all changes made. Git functions in a similar way for developers.  
          <br><br>
          Imagine that you are working on a group project and each member of the group needs to be able to access the project from different places, at the same time, and have the ability to make and save changes. Without some system in place, this scenario would definitely get a bit chaotic.  However, installing git onto your computer allows you to work on projects collaboratively with others in real time. It keeps track of the changes made, who made the changes and when.  Sure, I could get more technical than I have, go through a list of all sorts of git commands, but I shall not because what is most important for me to convey is that git is a tool that tremendously reduces the frustration that can mount as a result of working on the same files with multiple people. It does so by giving users the ability to track changes made to a file over time, while maintaining the various versions in an organized manner.
          <br><br>
          That's git in a nutshell.  I hope that was helpful!

      <h2 class="date">May 31, 2015</h2>
      <p class="post-content">
          Whoa! Week 2 of Dev Bootcamp has come to a SWIFT end.  We’re learning so much and SO fast.  During this week’s lesson’s we learned the difference between margins, borders, and padding.  I don’t know about you, but I’ve always had a clear understanding of what borders are, margins even, but you throw padding into the mix and I’m completely lost. I’ve seen padding written in CSS files before, but I’ve never been entirely sure what it is.  I was thrilled to get a bit of clarification and want to take just a brief moment to pass the info along so that you also can be clear!
          <br><br>
          A margin is the space around an element, and the more space that is around an element, the more space there is between that element and others.
          <br><br>
          Borders you may be more familiar with. A border is the edge of an element, essentially the line that outlines its perimeter. 
          <br><br>
          Now what we’ve all been waiting for…dun, dun, dun…padding. Padding is the space that exists between content and the border.  You are able to adjust CSS to move borders closer to or farther away from content.
          <br><br>
          Here is a picture that shows each.

          <p class="post-content">
              Just as individuals have preferred learning and working styles, most also have a preferred thinking style.
              <br><br>
              Thinking style assessments suggest that I am an abstract sequential thinker and, as such, I am someone who loves the world of theory and abstract thought. I believe that there is some truth to that.  Research suggests that learners who embrace this style of thinking have a tendency to analyze situations before making decisions or deciding to act; they apply logic when attempting to find solutions to problems and want the points they have to be heard.  With the exception of wanting my point to be heard—that’s not always very important to me—all of these things are pretty accurate concerning me. Further, research also suggests that abstract sequential thinkers  learn best when they are placed in stimulating environments, when they are able to work alone and when they have access to experts or references. The assertions included here are spot on.  
              <br><br>
              The idea of thinking styles and what works best for individuals who are more prone to one thinking style over another is interesting in relation to my experience at Dev Bootcamp. My cohort has officially completed 3 full  weeks of Phase 0, the 9 week remote period of the 19 week development intensive. We’ve all learned pretty quickly that Dev Bootcamp encourages, sometimes in a way that feels “gently” forcibly, to think about, talk about     feelings. Of the things that I have read about abstract sequential thinkers, of which I am, it’s been consistently written that expressing emotions and sentimental thinking is hard for them. There have been some requirements and activities that deal with becoming really personal, really fast, with people I don’t yet know that have certainly been uncomfortable from me. And, judging by the comments of others in the cohort, it has been uncomfortable for them as well. I think that we’re all just placing our trust in the process, pushing through that discomfort, complying and hoping for the best.
              <br><br>
              Otherwise, the DBC structure and curriculum has worked very well for my thinking style.  It has been an enormous amount of autonomous work with an adequate mix of resources provided for reference. While it does feel a bit “touchy-feely” at times, and that’s not usually my style, I am determined to always embrace a growth mindset. Just because getting in touch with my feelings with people I don’t yet know well has not been my jam in the past, I’m still developing as a human being and a good dose of the feels could be just what the doctor ordered.

          <h2 class="date">June 7, 2015</h2>
          <p class="post-content">
              So week 3 of my Dev Bootcamp experience has come to a close, and oh what a week it has been.  I’m still figuring out what it means to balance my life in the midst of full-time work, progressively challenging DBC assignments, and you know regular adulting (i.e. dishes, laundry, eating…getting out of bed, you get it).
              <br><br>
              This week’s lessons were an introduction to Ruby. Listen, Ruby is no HTML or CSS, and we’re definitely not in Kansas anymore.  But even, with that, it hasn’t been sooo bad. It’s just been time consuming and has required slightly more brain power than say— HTML. Well, I promised to share the things that I learn with you as I learn them. This week, we’re talking arrays and hashes.
              <br><br>
              In Ruby, an object-oriented language, arrays and hashes are both popular structures for storing data. While they have some similarities, they have some important differences. 
              <br><br>
              Arrays are essentially objects that contain ordered lists of other objects. You can store any kind or any combination of objects in an array. They are integer-indexed collections of any object. Arrays can be created by using brackets, []. For clarity’s sake, here is an example of an array provided by RubyMonk:
              <br><br>
              array = [1, ‘one’, 2, ‘two’].   
              <br><br>
              Hashes are collections of data structures that consist of key-value pairs.  Hashes are declared using curly braces, {}. Consider this example provided by RubyMonk:
              <br><br>
              student_ages = {<br>
                  "Jack" => 10,<br>
                  "Jill" => 12,<br>
                  "Bob" => 14<br>
                }.
              <br><br>
              The names that are listed are “keys” and the numbers that are listed are ‘values.’ You can both create a new Hash and retrieve a Hash by referring to its key.  Hashes are unordered.
              <br><br>
              So, both arrays and hashes store data…what sets them apart?  This was a little fuzzy for me too.  How I understand it though is that arrays are very much like simple containers. They store, or contain, things that you can call up (access value) using their index. For instance, in our example, array[0] gives you the result of ‘1.’ However, with Hashes, you define and customize keys to whatever you want and can then access their value using the keys you created.

        <h2 class="date">June 14, 2015</h2>
        <p class="post-content">
            It is no secret that tech has a diversity problem. The industry, as a whole, tends to be largely white and largely male.  Realizing that outputs can be limited and one dimensional when only certain groups are involved in the work and recognizing that everyone stands to win when diverse individuals are brought to the table, tech leaders are becoming more committed to addressing the problem. It makes sense that because people of all ethnic backgrounds, and both men and women, are engaging technologies that those charged with creating these technologies should represent all ethnic backgrounds and be both men and women. 
            <br><br>
            A recent CNN Money article posits that "the lack of gender and racial diversity within the tech industry is a problem that almost every Silicon Valley company is trying to solve."  Before recently, it's seemed that the tech industry had been secretive about the makeup of the workforce. However, in 2014, companies began to release their diversity statistics--confirming what most had already assumed, employees were mostly white men and lacked much diversity outside of Asian men. While this presently remains the case,  companies have vowed to be diligent about adding more women and minorities to their rosters. 
            <br><br>
            For some, this isn't just lip service. On June 9, 2015, Intel's investment arm, Intel Capital, launched a $125 million fund to invest in startups founded by female and underrepresented minority entrepreneurs. Facebook, which reported last year that 94% of its empoloyees are white or Asian and only 15% female, recently implemented a rule requiring at least one minority candidate be considered for open positions, similar to the NFL Rooney Rule. A number of other organizations are launching their own diversity efforts.  
            <br><br>
            It seems as if a tipping point may have actually been reached.  For women like me, anxious to launch careers in tech, we are watching to see what becomes of all this new discussion of diversity and the actions it is spurring.  I am hopeful that lasting change will be created, and am steeping with the excitement that very soon I'll be able to speak as both a woman and minority employed in tech!

        <h1 class="post-title">Let's Map it Out.</h1>
        <h2 class="date">June 21, 2015</h2>
        <p class="post-content">        
            The  weeks in Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 just KEEP winding down.  I hardly believe that Week 4 has ended.  We've been learning a ton and sometimes it can be a bit difficult to retain it all. I'm finding that it's helpful to teach the concepts I'm learning to other.  So be a pal, sit and listen for a sec while I talk through a helpful method I'v come across.
            <br><br>
            I recently came across a method that I thought could help me solve a challenge I was working on, map.  When I went to Ruby docs - Ruby docs is a collection of resources for folks just learning Ruby, btw - to get a better handle on it before giving it a twirl, the language I found was rather unhelpful.  The documentation tells you that what map does is "returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead." What the what. I mean, I GUESS all of those pieces make sense to me but when you're just starting out, some times you just want people to speak to you in Eglish. Not in tech.
            <br><br>
            After some more poking around, I was able to finally grasp what map actually does. Quite simply, it allows you to iterate over every element and whatever you return in the block is placed into a new array.  With this understanding I was able to go back to Ruby docs and totally understand what was being demonstrated in their example. I'll show you.
            <br><br>
            Let's use the same example Ruby docs uses for consistency's sake.  If we were to type in (1..4).map { |i| i*i } here is what the computer would spit back out to us: [1, 4, 9, 16].  Do you understand what's happening here?  Let's walk through it. For each number 1-4, we are multiplying that number by that same number. So we iterate over each element, essentially performing 1 * 1, 2 * 2, 3 * 3, and 4 * 4. You can see that the results would be 1, 4, 9 and 16.  Map then puts the result into a new array. Thus our output, again, would like [1, 4, 9, 16].  
            <br><br>
            Isn't that neat.  Helping walk you through that helped me! I hope going through those steps was actually helpful for you as well.

        <h1 class="post-title">An Awesome Pair.</h1>
        <h2 class="date">June 28, 2015</h2>
        <p class="post-content">
            Pair programming is a huge component of the Dev Bootcamp experience. Students spend loads of time working through problems with fellow cohort members. It's a great practice actually. It builds a foundational behavior that I am sure will serve us all well when we graduate and leave the program as newly minted developers.  
            <br><br>
            I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when pairing before starting Phase 0, the initial 9-week remote phase that all incoming students complete before arriving at campus. I do think that whatever it was I expected, I've been pleasantly surprised. Pairing isn't in the least horrible. At least, that's been my experience. I've been fortunate enough to work with really interesting people who have all been patient, respectful and kind. Luckily, I've not had a moment yet where things were overly frustrating and I found it difficult to work with someone. By and large my pair programming experience has been really rewarding, and beneficial. It gives me the opportunity to learn from my peers and I have been very grateful for that.
            <br><br>
            Dev Bootcamp students are also required to give and recieve feedback. After each pairing session, we log into an online system and provide feedback for our pairs that is actionable, specific and kind. This giving of and recieving feedback is also a unique and interesting experience.  I always love hearing feedback on the things I am doing, both things I'm doing well and not so much.  It gives me the chance to hear from others what it is like to work with me and offers my direct pointers about things I can immediately improve upon. I imagine that it may seem as if constantly having to hear from others about yourself, or telling others about themselves, can get a bit awkward but it really is something you get used to, and something you begin to very much look forward to. If you are interested in growing.
            <br><br>
            Despite the uncertainity about whether pair programming would be a positive experience and questioning the purpose of such an extensive feedback loop, ultimately, I believe that pairing is a critical component of the DBC curriculum and I've found feedback very useful.  I've really concluded that they are both integral to program design and I believe the awesome pair sets students up to achieve the greatest success possible while at DBC and beyond.
