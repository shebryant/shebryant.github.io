  <h1>At DBC, You WILL Feel All the Feels</h1>

Just as individuals have preferred learning and working styles, most also have a preferred thinking style.

Thinking stye assessments suggest that I am an abstract sequential thinker and, as such, I am someone who loves the world of theory and abstract thought.  I believe that there is some truth to that.  Research suggests that   learners who embrace this style of thinking have a tendency to analyze situations before making decisions or    deciding to act; they apply logic when attempting to find solutions to problems and want the points they have to be heard.  With the exception of wanting my point to be heard—that’s not always very important to me—all of these things are pretty accurate concerning me.  Further, research also suggests that abstract sequential thinkers  learn best when they are placed in stimulating environments, when they are able to work alone and when they have access to experts or references. The assertions included here are spot on.

The idea of thinking styles and what works best for individuals who are more prone to one thinking style over   another is interesting in relation to my experience at Dev Bootcamp. My cohort has officially completed 3 full  weeks of Phase 0, the 9 week remote period of the 19 week development intensive. We’ve all learned pretty quickly that Dev Bootcamp encourages, sometimes in a way that feels “gently” forcibly, to think about, talk about     feelings.  Of the things that I have read about abstract sequential thinkers, of which I am, it’s been consistently written that expressing emotions and sentimental thinking is hard for them. There have been some requirements and activities that deal with becoming really personal, really fast, with people I don’t yet know that have certainly been uncomfortable from me.  And, judging by the comments of others in the cohort, it has been uncomfortable for them as well.  I think that we’re all just placing our trust in the process, pushing through that discomfort, complying and hoping for the best.

Otherwise, the DBC structure and curriculum has worked very well for my thinking style.  It has been an enormous amount of autonomous work with an adequate mix of resources provided for reference.  While it does feel a bit “touchy-feely” at times, and that’s not usually my style, I am determined to always embrace a growth mindset.  Just because getting in touch with my feelings with people I don’t yet know well has not been my jam in the past, I’m still developing as a human being and a good dose of the feels could be just what the doctor ordered.
