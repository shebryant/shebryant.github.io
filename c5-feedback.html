  <h1>An Awesome Pair</h1>

Pair programming is a huge component of the Dev Bootcamp experience. Students spend loads of time working through problems with fellow cohort members. It's a great practice actually. It builds a foundational behavior that I am sure will serve us all well when we graduate and leave the program as newly minted developers.

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when pairing before starting Phase 0, the initial 9-week remote phase that all incoming students complete before arriving at campus. I do think that whatever it was I expected, I've been pleasantly surprised. Pairing isn't in the least horrible. At least, that's been my experience. I've been fortunate enough to work with really interesting people who have all been patient, respectful and kind. Luckily, I've not had a moment yet where things were overly frustrating and I found it difficult to work with someone. By and large my pair programming experience has been really rewarding, and beneficial. It gives me the opportunity to learn from my peers and I have been very grateful for that.

Dev Bootcamp students are also required to give and recieve feedback. After each pairing session, we log into an online system and provide feedback for our pairs that is actionable, specific and kind. This giving of and recieving feedback is also a unique and interesting experience.  I always love hearing feedback on the things I am doing, both things I'm doing well and not so much.  It gives me the chance to hear from others what it is like to work with me and offers my direct pointers about things I can immediately improve upon. I imagine that it may seem as if constantly having to hear from others about yourself, or telling others about themselves, can get a bit awkward but it really is something you get used to, and something you begin to very much look forward to. If you are interested in growing.

Despite the uncertainity about whether pair programming would be a positive experience and questioning the purpose of such an extensive feedback loop, ultimately, I believe that pairing is a critical component of the DBC curriculum and I've found feedbcak very useful.  I've really concluded that they are both integral to program design and I believe the awesome pair sets students up to achieve the greatest success possible while at DBC and beyond.
