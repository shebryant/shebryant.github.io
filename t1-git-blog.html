I can barely believe that the first week of my Dev Bootcamp experience has come and GONE! Wow, what a ride it's already been.  I'm so excited to learn so many new concepts, and SO fast.  It feels a bit like drinking from the fire hydrant.  I suppose I should get used to that; things won't slow down - they'll intensify. I want to hold on to every ounce of the material being crammed into my brain these days.  I've found that one of the best ways to retain new knowledge is to teach what you are learning to someone else.  So, the more I learn, the more I'm going to to share with YOU (and by you, I mean any poor soul who will listen)!

This week, we've been learning about git.  Technically speaking, (see what I did there?) git is a distributive version control system.  If you are anything like me just a week ago, you're definitely asking what the heck any of that means.  Well, version control is kind of a bit like Microsoft Word's or Pages' track changes feature.  The track changes feature in word processors allows different users to edit text, as well make comments, and it meticulously keeps track of all changes made.  Git functions in a similar way for developers.

Imagine that you are working on a group project and each member of the group needs to be able to access the project from different places, at the same time, and have the ability to make and save changes.  Without some system in place, this scenario would definitely get a bit chaotic.  However, installing git onto your computer allows you to work on projects collaboratively with others in real time.  It keeps track of the changes made, who made the changes and when.  Sure, I could get more technical than I have, go through a list of all sorts of git commands, but I shall not because what is most important for me to convey is that git is a tool that tremendously reduces the frustration that can mount as a result of working on the same files with multiple people.  It does so by giving users the ability to track changes made to a file over time, while maintaining the various versions in an organized manner.

That's git in a nutshell.  I hope that was helpful!
