  <h1>Houston, We Have a Problem</h1>

It is no secret that tech has a diversity problem. The industry, as a whole, tends to be largely white and largely male.  Realizing that outputs can be limited and one dimensional when only certain groups are involved in the work and recognizing that everyone stands to win when diverse individuals are brought to the table, tech leaders are becoming more committed to addressing the problem. It makes sense that because people of all ethnic backgrounds, and both men and women, are engaging technologies that those charged with creating these technologies should represent all ethnic backgrounds and be both men and women.

A recent CNN Money article posits that "the lack of gender and racial diversity within the tech industry is a problem that almost every Silicon Valley company is trying to solve."  Before recently, it's seemed that the tech industry had been secretive about the makeup of the workforce. However, in 2014, companies began to release their diversity statistics--confirming what most had already assumed, employees were mostly white men and lacked much diversity outside of Asian men. While this presently remains the case,  companies have vowed to be diligent about adding more women and minorities to their rosters.

For some, this isn't just lip service. On June 9, 2015, Intel's investment arm, Intel Capital, launched a $125 million fund to invest in startups founded by female and underrepresented minority entrepreneurs. Facebook, which reported last year that 94% of its empoloyees are white or Asian and only 15% female, recently implemented a rule requiring at least one minority candidate be considered for open positions, similar to the NFL Rooney Rule. A number of other organizations are launching their own diversity efforts.

It seems as if a tipping point may have actually been reached.  For women like me, anxious to launch careers in tech, we are watching to see what becomes of all this new discussion of diversity and the actions it is spurring.  I am hopeful that lasting change will be created, and am steeping with the excitement that very soon I'll be able to speak as both a woman and minority employed in tech!
